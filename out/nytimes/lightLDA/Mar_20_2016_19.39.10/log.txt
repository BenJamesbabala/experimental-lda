Running LDA inference using lightLDA
For dataset nytimes
For number of iterations 1000
For number of topics 1000
Using 50 sampler threads and 15 updater threads on bros
Running LDA inference using lightLDA
Now randomly initialising model variables for training
Initialising inference method specific data structures
Initializing the alias tables ...
We will perform a test on a heldout set.
